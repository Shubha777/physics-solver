# physics-solver
a prototype application for solving basic physics problems.

Requirements:

Python 3.0+, Sympy, PyLaTeX, and a LaTeX compiler.

Run parser.py to generate solutions. Solutions will be saved as a LaTeX .pdf. You'll need to edit the 'pdfopen.sh' shell script to open the .pdf file with your .pdf viewer.

To edit/create new problems, use the ProjectileMotion() class in Problems.py and alter it to your liking.
